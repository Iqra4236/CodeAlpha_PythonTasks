## Task 1: Hangman Game

**Overview:**
The Hangman Game is a classic text-based word-guessing game implemented in Java. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game imposes a limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed, adding a layer of challenge and strategy to the gameplay.

## *Key Features:*

**Random Word Generation:** The game selects a word at random, ensuring a unique experience with each playthrough.
**Interactive User Input:** Players interact with the game by inputting guesses letter by letter to reveal the hidden word.
**Challenge Mode:** A set limit on incorrect guesses increases the difficulty and engagement of the game.

## *Applications*:

This task is ideal for those interested in creating simple yet engaging text-based games. The Hangman Game serves as a foundational project for understanding the basics of programming logic and user interaction in a console environment.

## Task 2: Basic Chatbot

**Overview:**
The Basic Chatbot is a text-based conversational agent developed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. This project aims to create a chatbot capable of engaging in simple conversations with users, offering a foundation for more advanced natural language processing (NLP) applications.

## *Key Features:*

**Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes NLTK to process user inputs and generate appropriate responses, making the chatbot more conversational and user-friendly.
**Text-Based Interaction:** Engages users in dialogue through a text interface, simulating a basic conversational experience.
**Extensible Framework:** Provides a structure that can be expanded with additional NLP functionalities, allowing for the development of more sophisticated chatbot applications.

## *Applications:*
This chatbot serves as an introductory project for developers interested in NLP and AI-driven applications. It is particularly useful for learning the fundamentals of language processing and conversational design in Python.

## Task3: Task Automation with Python Scripts

**Overview:**
Task automation is a powerful approach to streamline repetitive tasks using Python scripts. This project involves identifying a specific repetitive task within your workflow—such as file organization, data cleaning, or system maintenance—and automating it to save time and reduce manual effort.

## *Key Features:*

**Automation of Repetitive Tasks:** Scripts are developed to handle tasks that would otherwise require manual repetition, increasing efficiency and accuracy.
**Customizable Solutions:** The scripts can be tailored to address specific needs, whether it's organizing files, cleaning data, or maintaining system operations.
**Scalability:** The automation framework can be extended to handle more complex or additional tasks as needed.

## *Applications:*
This task is perfect for professionals and developers looking to optimize their workflows. By automating mundane tasks, users can focus on more strategic and creative work, enhancing productivity and job satisfaction.
